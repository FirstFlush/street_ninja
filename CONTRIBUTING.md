# Contributing to Street Ninja

Thanks for your interest in **Street Ninja** â€” a text-based tool that helps people on the street quickly find food, shelter, jobs, and other essential resources. Contributions are welcome, but please note: the projectâ€™s biggest challenges right now are *not just technical*. Getting the word out, improving our data, and securing funding are just as important as writing code.

If you want to help, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

## ðŸ”§ How to Contribute

### 1. **Browse the Issues**
- Look for [`help wanted`](https://github.com/FirstFlush/street_ninja/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/FirstFlush/street_ninja/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
- Comment to claim an issue or ask questions.

### 2. **Share Ideas**
- If you have a feature suggestion or want to improve something, open a [discussion](https://github.com/FirstFlush/street_ninja/discussions).
- We're especially open to:
  - Smarter location parsing
  - Better ways to display results in under 320 characters
  - Low-tech ideas for reaching people who donâ€™t use the app yet

### 3. **Non-Code Help Needed**
- **Outreach** â€“ Street Ninja needs allies: nonprofits, shelters, service workers, and people with lived experience.
- **Funding** â€“ Help us apply to grants or spread the word to potential donors.
- **Data** â€“ Know of a food bank or shelter not listed? Open an issue or PR.
